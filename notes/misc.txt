Note about naming: its a constrained model, but since the constrained
model is a generalization of the non-constrained one, we should not
split the library into two separate "crf-chain2-tiers-constrained" 
and "crf-chain2-tiers" libraries.

Q: Do we lose some optimizations possibilities by doing that?
That is, do we lose anything by using constrained implementation
for the unconstrained model ?
